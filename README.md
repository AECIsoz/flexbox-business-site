#Project goals
In this project, I demonstrated my skills using flexbox to design and build the layout for an imaginary company’s homepage. I invented The Modern Knitting Society for my company, combining my hobbies of knitting and coding.

##Project requirements

Content-wise the homepage had to include:
- A title and logo or splash image.
- A mission statement or brief description of the company.
- A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
- A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.​

For this project I have used flexbox styling for layout. The aim was to use flexbox’s advantages, such as easy horizontal and vertical positioning, flexible element flows as the page size changes, and great styling for repeated elements.

I used flexbox to:
- Create a centered navbar at the top of the page.
- Create a flexible display of sections - Inspiration, Patterns, Wool & Needles and Accessories.
- Create a flexible display of company employees.

I also used media queries to adapt the design to different size screens.
